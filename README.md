# Bridge SDK

## What is Bridge?

Bridge is a platform that allows applications reside directly into any EHR with minimal setup.

## Who is this for?

Bridge is for companies who have applications and services HealthCare providers use as part of their business.

## Why do I need Bridge?

Bridge will save companies time and money by integrating once into Bridge and be available in any EHR. The SDK provides
an API to communicate with Bridge and get the data you need from the EHR.

## Bridge platform

### Integrate once, access everywhere

Spend time developing your product, not integrating into EHRs. Bridge is easy and fast to get started with. You can setup your
first application in less than an hour. Once your application has been published, it will be available in any EHR. 

### Single Sign-On (SSO)

Bridge also allows you to integrate into its authentication layer using well known authentication protocols such as OIDC and SAML. Your application
can launch without the need for the user to login each time. 

### Real-time interaction and feedback

Using the Bridge SDK you can retrieve and subscribe to patient information as it is being accessed in real-time. You can also
provide the EHR user with information via notifications, badges and Bridge SmartTiles&trade; that change based on the patient accessed in the EHR.
