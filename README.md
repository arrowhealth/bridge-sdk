## What is Bridge?

Bridge is a platform that resides inside any EHR. It extends the EHR with applications provided by vendors. 

## Why do I need Bridge?

Your company has spent a lot of time building an awesome product! As great as it may be, you are still competing
for that clinicians time. There is the additional pain of integrating
with EHRs. Some EHRs provide an integration, while others do not. Plus, the integration process is different for each EHR. Bridge
alleviates these issues by placing your product front and center in the EHR.

## Bridge platform

### Integrate once, access everywhere

Spend time developing your product, not integrating into EHRs. Bridge is easy and fast to get started with. You can setup your
first application in less than an hour. Once your application has been published, it will be available in any EHR. 

### Single Sign-On (SSO)

Bridge also allows you to integrate into its authentication layer using well known authentication protocols such as OIDC. Your application
can launch without the need for the user to login each time. 

### Real-time interaction and feedback

Using the Bridge SDK you can retrieve and subscribe to patient information as it is being accessed in real-time. You can also
provide the EHR user with information via notifications, badges and "live" tiles that change based on the patient accessed in the EHR.
